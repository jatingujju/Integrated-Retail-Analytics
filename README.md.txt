Sales & Partner Insights Dashboard - README

# ?? Sales & Partner Insights Dashboard  

A data analytics project analyzing historical sales data to generate insights and forecast future trends.  
This project demonstrates **data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and visualization techniques** for business decision-making.

## ?? Project Structure  
```
??? data/               # Sample datasets (sales, stores, features)  
??? notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for EDA & modeling  
??? src/                # Source code for preprocessing, training, evaluation  
??? models/             # Saved ML models (joblib)  
??? visuals/            # Graphs, plots, dashboards  
??? requirements.txt    # Python dependencies  
??? README.md           # Project documentation  
```

## ? Features  
- Sales data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Forecasting using **Random Forest Regressor**  
- Visualizations of **predicted vs. actual sales**  
- Feature importance analysis  
- Modular codebase for reusability

## ??? Installation  

1. Clone this repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-partner-insights.git
cd sales-partner-insights
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ?? Usage  

1. Run preprocessing & training scripts:  
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

2. Explore insights via Jupyter notebooks:  
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

3. View saved models & visualizations in respective folders.  

---

## ?? Dataset  
- **Sales Data** – historical sales records  
- **Stores Data** – store information (location, type, etc.)  
- **Features Data** – seasonal, promotional, and external factors  

> Only sample datasets are included. Original datasets excluded due to size/privacy.  

---

## ?? Approach  
1. Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
2. Train a Random Forest Regressor  
3. Evaluate using sales predictions vs. actuals  
4. Visualize feature importance & forecasts  

---

## ?? Results  
- The Random Forest model forecasts sales trends effectively  
- Promotions, holidays, and store type were key features  
- Visualizations demonstrate predicted vs. actual performance  

---

## ?? Future Work  
- Experiment with XGBoost/LightGBM  
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI)  
- Enable real-time sales forecasting  

---

## ?? Tech Stack  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Excel (data exploration & storage)  
- Joblib (model persistence)
